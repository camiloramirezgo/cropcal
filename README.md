# Cropland Calibration Algorithm
## Installation
To use the GIS-based calibration algorithm, you need to have installed python and Jupyter Notebooks. 
A good option is to installed them via Anaconda Navigator, which will install all required libraries for the process.

## Running the algorithm
The algorithm consist in one Python file "Cropcal.py" which contains all the required function for the calibration process,
and a Jupyter Notebook file "Cropland calibration runner.ipynb" which will guide the user through the calibration process.

You will only need to use the Jupyter Notebook file "Cropland calibration runner.ipynb", as all the relevant functions 
will be called from there. Moreover, all the instructions and explaination of the calibration process,
can be found in the same file.
